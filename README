calendar application demo (tested on Ubuntu LTS 14.04 and Debian 8 host environment)

Host build dependency lib required cunit for unit test.

Build step:

1. If you do not want to do the unittest, comment the unit test part in the Makefile (e.g # TEST_TARGET=unittest/testapp ).

Install cunit lib on a Debian/Ubuntu distribution.

sudo apt-get install libcunit1

sudo apt-get install libcunit1-dev

2. If you want more verbose debug message info, you could turn on the debug print by remove comment on (#CFLAGS +=-D$(DEBUG_ON)).

3. Build the calendar application with a shell script build.sh

chmod a+x build.sh && ./build.sh

two application will be compiled if everything goes well: ./calendar  and ./unittest/testapp.

4. Launch the application ./calendar

   or launch the test application ./unittest/testapp for unittest.
