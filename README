calendar application demo

test platform:

1. tested on Ubuntu LTS 14.04 and Debian 8 host environment with GNU/GCC tool-chain

2. tested on Raspberry Pi 2 cross-compiled with ARM LINARO tool-chain.

Host build dependency lib required cunit for unit test.

Build step for Host:

1. If you do not want to do the unittest, comment the unit test part in the Makefile (e.g # TEST_TARGET=unittest/testapp ).

Install cunit lib on a Debian/Ubuntu distribution.

sudo apt-get install libcunit1

sudo apt-get install libcunit1-dev

2. If you want more verbose debug message info, you could turn on the debug print by remove comment on (#CFLAGS +=-D$(DEBUG_ON)).

3. Build the calendar application with a shell script build.sh

chmod a+x build.sh && ./build.sh

two application will be compiled if everything goes well: ./calendar  and ./unittest/testapp.

4. Launch the application ./calendar

   or launch the test application ./unittest/testapp for unittest.


Build step for ARM cross-compilation.

1. Download ARM LINARO toolchain from http://releases.linaro.org/14.03/components/toolchain/binaries/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2014.03_linux.tar.xz

2. Decompress the toolchain and place it into a folder.

3. Comment the first line in Makefile e.g #BUILD_OPT=HOST_LINUX
   Uncomment the second line
   #BUILD_OPT=ARM_LINARO
   #ARM_LINARO_PATH=../gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2014.03_linux

   and replace ARM_LINARO_PATH with your ARM LINARO tool-chain path.

4. build command chmod a+x build.sh && ./build.sh

5. If everything goes well, a executed file calendar cross-compiled for arm platform is created.

6  Launch it on a Raspberry Pi platform or in a virtual machine environment like QEMU.
